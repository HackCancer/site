intro: |
    Being diagnosed with cancer sucks, that's why a team of friends in London decided to do something about it and Hack Cancer was born. On October 10th – 11th 2015, forty of the best developers and doctors from around the world, gathered at _Google Campus_ to build products to beat cancer.

    Now the community decided to keep up with the project and organize the next chapter, a Cancer Datathon.

        Our non-profit organisation relies on sponsors who see the value of supporting this kind of charitable and innovative event. Their collaboration will allow us to provide a fantastic venue, judges, talks, food, beverages, prizes and support after the datathon for the Hack Cancer attendees. Moreover, the cash sponsors will help us reach our goal of raising over 5.000€ for the Aspanogi and Gipuzkoa Contra el Cancer societies.
