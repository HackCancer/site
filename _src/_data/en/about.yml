        research in the field of cancer using  of the latest advances of the

        Being diagnosed with cancer sucks, for that reason a group of friends
        in London decided to do something about it and HackCancer was born.
        From October 10 to 11, 2015, forty of the best developers and doctors
        from around the world met on Google Campus to create products to fight
        cancer.

        Now the community that was created during the event has decided to keep
        up with the project and we are setting up the next chapter, a Datathon.
