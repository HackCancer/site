Any excuse is a good excuse to visit San Sebastián. Apart from the matchless beauty of the Concha Bay which dazzled royalty at the start of last century and continues to captivate all who visit it, San Sebastián is the scene of a cutting-edge gastronomy thanks to which it has earned worldwide fame, several festivals that have turned the city into an out-and-out cultural phenomenon and an active, healthy lifestyle in close contact with its natural resources.

This, together with its numerous conference infrastructures, its wide range of accommodation and its strategic location promise not only a successful business trip, but also an unforgettable stay.
